# MCP Compatibility Report

This document summarizes the compatibility issues between different Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations and the solutions implemented in this project.

## Identified Compatibility Issues

The following compatibility issues were identified across different MCP implementations:

1. **Protocol Negotiation Differences**
   - Different implementations require different fields in the `initialize` request
   - Some implementations require explicit `protocolVersion` and `capabilities`
   - FastMCP implementations have differing requirements for client authentication

2. **Tool Call API Differences**
   - Implementations differ in how tools are called (`tools/call` vs direct methods)
   - Parameter validation mechanisms vary between implementations
   - Error handling and response formats differ

3. **Event Handling Differences**
   - Session connection handling varies between implementations
   - Some implementations require explicit client initialization

4. **Transport-level Differences**
   - Some implementations only support stdio transport
   - Others support HTTP/SSE transport options

## Compatibility Solutions

The following solutions have been implemented to address these compatibility issues:

1. **Multi-protocol Negotiation**
   - Implemented a protocol negotiation layer that tries multiple protocol formats
   - Added fallback mechanisms for different client initialization formats
   - Enhanced error handling to support different error response formats

2. **Flexible Tool Calling**
   - Implemented alternative tool call methods to support different MCP implementations
   - Added fallbacks for tool parameter validation
   - Normalized tool response formats

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added robust error handling with diagnostic information
   - Implemented graceful degradation when certain features are not available
   - Provided fallback mock data for testing when real data cannot be retrieved

4. **Compatibility Testing Framework**
   - Created a comprehensive compatibility test suite
   - Test suite automatically tries different protocol variants
   - Test reports help identify specific compatibility issues

## Implementation Notes

### FastMCP Compatibility

The FastMCP implementation (`fastmcp` package) requires specific initialization parameters:

```javascript
// Required initialization for FastMCP
const initMessage = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  method: 'initialize',
  params: {
    clientInfo: {
      name: 'ClientName',
      version: '1.0.0'
    },
    protocolVersion: '1.0',
    capabilities: {
      models: ['claude-3-opus-20240229', 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229'],
      tools: {}
    }
  },
  id: 1
};
```

### Azure MCP Compatibility

Azure MCP implementation has different requirements for tool calling:

```javascript
// Azure MCP tool call format
const callToolMessage = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  method: `tools/${toolName}`, // Direct method naming
  params: args,
  id: 1
};
```

### Browser-use MCP Server Compatibility

Browser-use MCP Server requires HTTP/SSE transport configuration:

```javascript
// Browser-use MCP Server configuration
const server = createCompatibleMcpServer(config);
await server.start({
  transportType: 'sse',
  sse: {
    endpoint: '/v1/mcp',
    port: 3000
  }
});
```

## Testing Your MCP Implementation

To test your MCP implementation against our compatibility layer, run:

```bash
node test-compatibility.js
```

This will execute a series of tests to verify compatibility across different protocol variants and report any issues.
